StreamAlerts is a Manifest V3 Extension developed by [@QQtin](https://github.com/QQtin3) based on the Twitch API. The extension allows users to "follow" their favorite streamers.
Follow a streamer will make appear a new box into the extension where user will be able to see multiple things such as :
1. Streamer's Twitch profile picture
2. Steamer's Username
3. If the Streamer is Twitch partner (add a certified logo next to Streamer's name)
4. If the Streamer is currently streaming (refers to the color of the circle green/red)
5. If the Streamer is streaming allows to see the stream's title and game.

Extension also offers a way to get notifications when a streamer is starting streaming! By default this function is enabled but can be disabled in the settings menu.
When user clicks on the box with streamer's information it redirects to the streamer's Twitch channel and the same thing happen if the notification is clicked on.
