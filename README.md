StreamAlerts is a Manifest V3 Extension developed by [@QQtin](https://github.com/QQtin3) based on the Twitch API. The extension allows users to "follow" their favorite streamers.
Follow a streamer will make a new box appear  into the extension where user will be able to see multiple things such as :
1. Streamer's Twitch profile picture
2. Steamer's Username
3. If the Streamer is Twitch partner (add a certified logo next to Streamer's name)
4. If the Streamer is currently streaming (refers to the color of the circle green/red)
5. If the Streamer is streaming allows to see the stream's title and game.

Extension also offers a way to get notifications when a streamer is starting streaming! By default notifications function is enabled but can be disabled in the settings menu.
When a user clicks on the box with streamer's information it redirects to the streamer's Twitch channel and the same thing happens if the notification is clicked on.
